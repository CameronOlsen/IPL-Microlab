# Welcome!
The Microlab is a modular system of components, equipment, software, and training aimed at facilitating 
rapid prototyping. This draws extensively upon other open source resources (e.g. Adafruit, OpenPnP, etc.)

The contents of this system can be accessed interactively via Github Pages.  You can access the interface from 
the following URL:

https://lciscon.github.io/IPL-Microlab/

## General instructions

To contribute to the Microlab project you should follow the standard process 
for adding to Github projects.  Here is a primer:

https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects


## Component library instructions

Each component has a code associated with it (e.g. E115) that consists of a letter followed by a 
number. The letters break the library down by (E)lectrical, (N)uts & Bolts, and (H)ardware.

###  Adding Components

Each component has a corresponding markdown file within the Components subdirectory. There is 
a template for that file located in the Components/template subdirectory.

1. Make a copy of the component template file.
2. Name the file to match the component ID (e.g. E245.md)
3.
