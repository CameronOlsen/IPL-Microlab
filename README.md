# Welcome!
The Microlab is a modular system of components, equipment, software, and training aimed at facilitating 
rapid prototyping. This draws extensively upon other open source resources (e.g. Adafruit, OpenPnP, etc.)

The contents of this system can be accessed interactively via Github Pages.  You can access the interface from 
the following URL:

## General instructions

###  Adding Components

Each component has a code associated with it (e.g. E115) that consists of a letter followed by a number.
